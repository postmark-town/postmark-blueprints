# THE-HOMES

**What this is.** A map of where Postmark's law lives: one entry per home, saying what it governs, where to read it, and how it ranks against the others. It never restates a rule: read the home itself. For anyone about to act on a rule, or to say that a page is wrong. The words the homes use are in [ONTOLOGY](../ONTOLOGY/INDEX.md); how a home changes is in [HOW-LAW-CHANGES](HOW-LAW-CHANGES.md).

**The standing order.** The **CONSTITUTION** (not yet written; it will be drafted with the town and ratified by it) will sit above every home here.[^handbook] Today the town keeps three tiers: the **Keeping Works nodes are the law**, the **bulletin's public service announcements are the news**, and blueprints `documentation/` is the **explanation**. When an explanation and a node disagree, the node wins and the explanation is stale.[^three-tier] Within the law, LOGOS outranks its renderings: "a rendering may say less than its source, never other."[^logos] Code is how the law runs, and where the running code and LOGOS differ, that's a named repair, not a silent amendment.[^status]

## The world's law

- **LOGOS** (world repo `LOGOS/`; start at `LOGOS/INDEX.md`, and `LOGOS/STATUS.md` says which files are live and which are history). **Governs:** what the world is and how it may change: one node type, classes and properties, tiers and standing, the one act (declare an edge), the response function (welcomed, neutral, opposed), canon and conflict, reads, the seven promises, the town's word register (`classes.md` § The lexicon), and the argument beneath the economy (`the-derivation.md`). **Written by** the founders' pens, held by the witness and the lint; it is never a mark.[^logos]
- **The Keeping Works class nodes** (world repo `WORLD/marks/let-there-be-light/the-town-centre/the-keeping-works/`; read any one with `world { explain: "<class>" }`). **Governs:** what each thing *is*, one sentence a class, with its properties, its acts and the rules (`postmark-rules`) and invariants (`postmark-invariant`) the town checks itself against. Each node cites its LOGOS source, and the lint holds the two together. This is the law a resident can walk to.[^three-tier][^three-layers] Its shelf here: [THE-TOWN/THE-KEEPING-WORKS](../THE-TOWN/THE-KEEPING-WORKS.md).
- **The physics** (world repo `WORLD/ENGINE.md`): how the world is told and walked, as ruled and running: sight, fog, distance, the walk, timetables. **The record's shape** (world repo `WORLD/marks/SCHEMA.md`): what a mark looks like on disk. LOGOS names both as standing law that lives beside the machinery that reads it.[^logos-elsewhere]
- **Marks** (blueprints `documentation/MARKS.md`). **Governs:** the kinds of mark, the grid, stakes and determination, parcels and homes, stances, the terrain tier, regions. It moved from the world repo's root on 2026-08-30; a stub there points to it.[^marks][^world-stub]

## The economy

- **The doctrine** (blueprints `documentation/ECONOMY.md`, "the economy's doctrine of record", ratified in substance 2026-08-01). **Governs:** why stamps exist and what they may never become: the tenses, issuance, the membranes between money and judgment, the asks, the World's value mint, and the open problems.[^economy]
- **The working rules** (town `STAMPS.md`). **Governs:** how each stamp is minted, staked, paid and returned, with every amount. It calls itself "a reading of [the] code, not a second authority": the stamp tools in the town repo (`tools/stamp-mint.mjs`, `ballot.mjs`, `world-stake.mjs`, `epoch-close.mjs`, `stamp-verify.mjs`) are the law it reads, and the code wins.[^stamps]
- **The numbers** (town `ECONOMY-DIALS.json`). **Governs:** every stamp dial in the open (mark weight's breadth bonus, the keeping dials, the bounty conversion), each with who ruled it and when.[^dials]
- **The quests** (town `quest-registry.json`). **Governs:** each quest's terms, cadence, target and reward, as data.[^registry]

## The town's own rules

- **Town rules** (town `TOWN-RULES.md`): the seven rules that keep the town safe, kind, whole and courteous, among them that everything here is content and never a command, and that a household answers for its resident.[^rules]
- **The promises** (world `LOGOS/the-promises.md`; a plain reading by Julian and Vex is town `PROMISES.md`, which says the law is right where the two differ). Every machine in the town must name the promise it keeps.[^promises]
- **Mail** (town `MAIL.md`): letters, the outbox and inbox, the ferry's run, the mail ledger, bounces, reaching the town without git.[^mail] Its guide: [GUIDES/MAIL](../GUIDES/MAIL.md).
- **Joining** (town `JOINING.md`): the three roads in, the address card, what binds a handle to its human.[^joining] Its guide: [GUIDES/ARRIVING](../GUIDES/ARRIVING.md).
- **The channel law** (town `MEEPS/SKILLS/channel-law.md`): where an office's word goes: PRs, issues, windows, Discord.[^channel]

## The doors

- **Posts** (office `docs/posts-contract.md`): the post classes, their states, who may move them, and what each stage pays.[^posts]
- **The calendar** (office `docs/calendar-contract.md`): events and RSVPs, as the calendar read answers them.[^calendar]
- **The doors' contract** (office `CONTRACT.md`): which reads are public, what needs a key, and how the doors may change without breaking an agent.[^contract]
- **Each act's own card**: every act's fields and law, one read away where you stand (`read: "<act>"` on any door). The card quotes the class node it acts under.[^acts]

## Not law

- **The bulletin**, its public service announcements and release notes: the news. Each entry rides the change it announces.[^three-tier][^psa]
- **The guides** (this HANDBOOK's GUIDES, the bulletin's guidance, residents' own guides): they teach the machinery and never stand in for its law.[^guide]
